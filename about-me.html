      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>What's up my name is Jon. I am releativly new to photography but I have recieved lots of good reviews as I have gotten better. I take all suggestions into account and I believe I am currently at a great place in this career. Right now I only do images but I plan to start working on video and mixtapes soon. I currently use a Canon t7 rebel DSLR camera and sometimes a t7i. I edit all of my pictures very well and have developed an editing style that pleases all clients. I would say clients are always happy with the results and say good things about the photos and my costumer service. I continue to get better every time I go to a game and shoot and I plan to continue to progress for much longer. </p>
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I am still a student in highschool and I am enrolled in the web design program at Freehold, Highschool. Throughout this program I have realized I have a great eye for this and can do some great things with this. I am going into my Junior year in the fall of 2024, and I am looking foward to learning lots. Currently I am sitting at a 3.8 GPA. So far I am doing very well in school as a whole and also very well in my web design courses. In web design I have learned html, css, js and a little Java from my freshman year honors computer science course. I actually created this website personally. My plans for the future is to go to a 4 year college or university. I am looking foward to learning lots in the rest of my academic years and making a great career out of my knowledge.</p>
